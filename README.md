Manage color combinations of armor in BOTW

## What is this?

In Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, you can find/earn armor throughout the game. There is also a [shop](https://www.zeldadungeon.net/wiki/Kochi_Dye_Shop) in the game where you can go to change the color of your armor.

However, this process is fairly painful. You have to dye your head, body, and leg armor all at once. If you want to dye pieces different colors, you'll have to use your imagination to think of how it will look.

This tool lets you get an idea of what color combinations will look like, without having to go to the dye shop. I wanted this so I could pick something that looked good, and then went to the shop in the game, knowing what I was going to get.

## About This Site

To create the images I used the screenshot feature on the Switch and then wrote a script to crop all the pictures. All the images (uncropped and cropped) are available on GitHub.

This site is open-source (MIT License) so you can fork/modify it as needed. If you do, I'd love to know what you are doing.

If you find any issues or have any suggestions, please use [GitHub's issue tracking system](https://github.com/mrnohr/botw-armor/issues). I'm not great at CSS or JavaScript, so if you have improvements, feel free to create a pull request.
